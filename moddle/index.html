<h1>Moddle</h1>
<p id="mainflavor">Moddle is an open-source Minecraft launcher and modpack creation framework.  Its purpose is to make modpack creation a quick and easy process for anyone and everyone who wants to make their own modpack.  It also provides a simple and straightforward method of modpack distribution by serving as a standard platform for building modpacks.  Moddle's core libraries are also completely available to and for anyone who wants to take advantage of their functionalities and integrate them into their own Minecraft launcher!</p>

<section id="download">
<h1>Download Moddle</h1>
<p id="downloadflavor">The easiest way to get the open alpha version of Moddle is by using Mince, the Moddle installer. Note that you must have <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">Python 3</a> for Moddle to work in addition to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851">.NET 3 or later</a> for the graphical launcher if you are on Windows.</p>
<p id="supportedarch">While Moddle supports all platforms, the graphical launcher is currently only available on Windows. We're working on bringing the full Moddle experience to everyone, though! Until then, you'll launch into the Moddle Shell on Mac or Linux, which is fairly easy to use and is documented <a href="shelldocs.html">here</a>.</p>
